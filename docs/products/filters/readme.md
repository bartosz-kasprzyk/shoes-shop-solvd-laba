# Filters docs

### Goals

- **Semi-modular design** → balance between reusability and avoiding unnecessary fragmentation.  
- **DRY principle** → reduce code duplication across filters with similar logic.  
- **Context-driven architecture** → eliminate prop drilling and make components more composable.  
- **Maintainability** → allow easy extension or adjustment of logic for specific filter types without affecting others.
